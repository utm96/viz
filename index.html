        <p><b>Research question:</b>
        <p style="color: #eba291;">
          What portion of tasks in a given job role are automated and which ones still
          require human intervention due to the integration of generative AI models in different industries?</p>

        <p><b>How to Read the Visualization?</b></p>
        <!-- <p>Start by observing the overall layout of rectangles, each symbolizing a different domain.
          Note the size of each rectangle to gauge the volume of tasks in that domain. Then, focus on the color shading
          within these rectangles to assess the impact of AI on specific job roles.
          Lighter shades mean less automation and more need for human intervention, while darker shades signal higher
          automation levels.
          This visualization offers an interactive feature where viewers can zoom in on a particular domain (by clicking
          on that particular domain) to examine
          the specific job roles it contains. This closer look provides detailed insights into the degree
          of AI's impact on each role, highlighting the tasks automated by AI versus those still requiring human
          expertise.
          After exploring a domain in detail, users can zoom out (by clicking on the left top corner of the tree map )
          to return to the broader view, allowing them to explore
          other domains and compare the effects of AI across different industries.

            <!-- It illustrates the impact of generative AI on the job market by mapping out the extent to which tasks within
            various job roles are automated.
            It does this through a series of rectangles, each representing a distinct domain, such as healthcare, finance,
            or technology.
            The size of each rectangle reflects the total number of tasks within that domain.
            Inside these rectangles, job roles are identified, and the impact of AI on these roles is depicted through a
            spectrum of reds.
            The color coding conveys the percentage of tasks automated by AI within each role: lighter shades denote a lower
            impact (fewer tasks automated), and darker shades indicate a higher impact (more tasks automated).</p> -->

            This visualization is specifically designed for university students who are navigating their career paths in an
            evolving job market.
            It helps these students understand which industries and job roles are undergoing significant transformations due
            to AI technologies.
            By providing a clear picture of the AI-driven changes, students can make informed decisions about their
            education and career planning,
            focusing on areas that align with future job market trends.

            University students should take an interest in this visualization because it directly affects their future
            career prospects. As AI continues to reshape the workplace,
            understanding which job roles are most susceptible to automation and which will require human skills that AI
            cannot replicate is crucial.
            This knowledge enables students to pursue fields with enduring demand for human expertise, ensuring their skills
            remain relevant and valuable in the long term.
            Additionally, it offers insights into emerging roles and industries, guiding students towards opportunities in
            AI-driven growth areas.
